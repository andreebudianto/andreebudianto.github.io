        <p>This week I got a group project, building any websites. And fortunate for me (unfortunate for them, lol), I teamed with more experienced students in HTML CSS. One of my group-mate use this <strong>a:hover</strong> and <strong>transition</strong> in his CSS, creating an animation and interactivity. I was amazed since I thought that kind of interactivity would happen only using scripts. And this is why I choose boot camp over self-learning, because I could meet more brilliant and same-minded people that would broaden my horizons.</p>
        <p>Below, I re-write the code the simplified codes for you, just in case you want to use it.</p>
