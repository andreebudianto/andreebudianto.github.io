            <h1>Welcome to Bite-size Shift!</h1>
        </div>

        <p>My journal of learning web developer, hoping to make a shift to the industry.</p>
        <p>This is something big, a life-changing period of my life.     At first, I was amazed, I was overwhelmed, I doubt my self, I want to go back.</p>
        <p>But deep inside, I know I want to give it a try! Time is not going backward anyway, better try it now than later.</p>
        <p>For those taking this path, drop me a <a href="hi.html">Hi!</a> I would need every support and help in this journey.</p>
        <p>For those who consider make the shift to web development but still cautiously observing options available for you, I am gladly share this experience with you. Feel free to ask <a href="hi.html">anything.</a> Literally, anything.</p>
        <p>Enjoy your stay! </p>
